Like coding referring to a snippet of code on a webpage, or typing some text in a picture someone sent to you.\r\n\r\nInspired by the jailbreak tweak [Snapper 2](http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=snapper2Dp) on iOS.\r\n\r\n![gif](Assets/pinshot.gif)\r\n\r\nThe global shortcut is `Shift + Option + Command + 4`, which can be customized in the preference window.\r\n\r\nDouble click to dismiss. Drag to resize. Scroll to adjust opacity.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not designed to do that but you can still right click to save the screenshot.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nThe pods directory is not included in the repo so you need to run `pod install` manually:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/JeziL/PinShot.git\r\ncd PinShot\r\npod install\r\nopen PinShot.xcworkspace\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed, [install it](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation).\r\n\r\n",
